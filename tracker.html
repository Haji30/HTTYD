                <h3>Deadly Nadder<p>(deadly nadder)</p></h3>
                <img src="img/nadder.png" alt="Deadly Nadder">
                <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Deadly Nadders can suddenly raise the hundreds of sharp spines that stud their hides and tails and fling them with incredible accuracy. But when the shooting starts, there is no safer place to be than face-to-face with a Nadder â€” If you stand right in front of its nose, a Nadder won't be able to see you. It may not be the biggest or the fastest, but the Deadly Nadder has the hottest fire of any dragon.</p></li>
                </ul><br>
                <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>In appearance, the Deadly Nadder is very beautiful and bird-like, it is bipedal, and possesses winged forelimbs. Its small yet keen eyes, equipped with poor binocular vision, are one of the tools it uses to stalk its targets.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Its body is vividly colored, with a light beige underbelly, while its wings are mottled, darker shades. In front of its eyes is its curved nasal horn, which is often used to batter opponents; its lower jaw is shorter and wider than its upper, giving it an overbite.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Ringing its skull is a crown of spikes. Coating the tail is a series of poisonous spines which can be fired at an opponent with deadly accuracy. When relaxed, its head spikes and venomous tail spines lay flat, but when alarmed, they shoot upward to intimidate its foe. The tail spikes can also be used to make a rattling noise which it makes right before it attacks, similar to a rattlesnake's.</p></li>
                    <li><p>9.91 meters long & 3.52 meters tall</p></li>
                </ul><br>
                <p><strong>How to train them:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>To train a Deadly Nadder, one must very carefully approach the dragon from its tail. Then, you must gently smooth its spikes down. In addition, one can also train a Nadder by sneaking up on its blind spot, then scratching its chin affectionately.</p></li>
