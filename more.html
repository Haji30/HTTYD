        <h1>This is Berk....</h1>
        <article>
            <p>It's twelve days north of hopeless and few degrees south of freezing to death. It's located  solidiy on the meridian of misery. Our village, In a word, sturdy. It's been here for seven generations, but every single building is new. We have fishingg, hunting, annd a charming view of the sunsets. The only  problems are the pests. You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes. But us, we have... dragons.</p><br>

            </ul>
            </div>
            <p>It snows nine months of the year and hails the other three. Any food that grows here is tough and tasteless. The people that grow here are even more so. While other places have ponies or parrots... we have... dragons.  Dragons used to be a bit of a problem here, but that was years  ago. Now they've all moved in. And, really, why wouldn't they? We have custom stabels, all-you-can-eat feeding stationns, a full service dragon wash... Even top-of-the-line fire prevention, if I do say so myself.</p><br>

            </div>
            <p>A bit trampled and busted and covered in ice, but it's home. It's our home. Those who attacked usare relentless and crazy. But those who stopped them? Oh...  even more so! We may be small in numbers, but we stand for something bigger than anything the world can pit against us. We are the voice of peace. And bit by bit, we will change this world. You see, we have something they don't. Oh sure they have armies, and they have armadas, but we... we have... dragons.</p><br>
            <p>To all aspiring dragon riders out there, we are calling on you to join us in a new chapter of our village's legacy. With our dragons, we've forged an unbreakable bond that extends beyond anything the world has ever seen. But to master the skies and truly harness the power of these magnificent creatures, we need more brave souls. Training dragons requires not only courage but also patience, understanding, and heart. It's not an easy path, but those who succeed will become part of something extraordinay. Together, we will rise above every storm, every challange, and shape the future of our village and the world. Will you answer the call? <a href="join.html">Join us</a>, and become a dragon rider today!</p><br>
