            <h3>The Dragon Rider Academy is the finest institution for taming and training dragons. Located in the heart of Berk, we teach riders everything they need to build strong bonds with their dragons and become legendary heroes.</h3>
            <p>The Dragon Rider Academy is more than just a school, it's a community where humans and dragons bond to achieve greatness. 
            Founded by the legendary Hiccup Haddock and his Night Fury companion, Toothless, the academy has trained generations of riders to master the skies and protect their homes.</p>
            <p><strong>Our academy is built on three core values:</strong></p>

            </ul>

            <h2>Our Training Program</h2>
            <ul>
                <p><strong>Dragon Bonding 101:</strong> Establish trust with your dragon.</p>
                <p class="train">At the heart of every rider-dragon partnership is trust built through patience and empathy. This course focuses on teaching students how to understand and communicate with their dragon using subtle cues, such as posture, growls, and eye contact. Since every dragon has a unique personality, riders must learn how to adapt their approach—whether their dragon is playful, stubborn, or cautious. The bonding process begins with basic activities, such as feeding sessions and grooming, helping the dragon become comfortable with human presence. As the bond strengthens, students participate in first-flight exercises, where dragons gradually learn to carry their riders. They will also learn techniques for handling trust-breaking situations, such as regaining a dragon’s confidence after a mistake. Overcoming fear—both for the dragon and rider—is another critical element of this course. By the end, students will have developed a bond where the dragon no longer sees them as just a rider but as a lifelong companion.</p>
                <p><strong>Flight Mastery:</strong> Learn to navigate the skies with precision.</p>
                <p class="train">Flight training requires more than simply holding on during a ride—it demands precision, focus, and seamless coordination between rider and dragon. This course begins with the basics: smooth takeoffs, controlled landings, and perfecting mid-air stability. Riders practice these fundamentals in controlled environments before tackling more advanced drills, such as sharp dives, barrel rolls, and fast turns to avoid obstacles. As the training progresses, students face increasingly difficult challenges—like flying through storm clouds, maintaining altitude in strong winds, and navigating low-visibility conditions at night. The academy offers obstacle courses designed to simulate real-world situations, such as narrow valleys or sudden gusts of wind. Group flying exercises are introduced in the latter part of the course, teaching riders how to fly in formation with others to carry out complex missions. Those who excel at Flight Mastery not only gain control over their dragon but also develop a sense of freedom that can only be experienced in the skies.</p>
                <p><strong>Dragon Combat And Rescue Mission:</strong> Train for aerial battles and rescue missions.</p>
                <p class="train">Every dragon rider must be prepared to defend their home and assist those in need. This course focuses on both combat techniques and rescue operations, ensuring riders are equipped for any situation. In combat training, students learn how to coordinate attacks with their dragons, using their dragon’s unique abilities—such as fire breathing, gas bursts, or spiked tail strikes—to their advantage. They practice evasive maneuvers like aerial loops and sharp dives to dodge incoming threats. The course also emphasizes defensive strategies, such as using dragon fire to create barriers or distractions. Beyond combat, rescue operations play a critical role. Riders are trained to perform search-and-rescue missions in difficult terrain, such as dense forests or raging seas. These missions teach students how to remain calm under pressure and make quick decisions, like whether to engage an enemy or prioritize evacuating civilians. The course culminates in team-based simulations where riders must work together to save lives, blending combat skills with rescue expertise. Through these exercises, students learn that being a rider is about more than strength—it’s about courage, compassion, and the responsibility to protect.</p>
                <p><strong>Advanced Care:</strong> Understand dragon behavior and well-being.</p>
                <p class="train">Caring for a dragon goes far beyond feeding and grooming—it requires understanding their physical needs, emotional well-being, and unique behaviors. This course dives deep into dragon biology, teaching students how to recognize signs of illness, stress, or fatigue. Riders learn how to treat minor injuries, such as wing tears or claw fractures, and administer basic first aid in emergencies. The course also covers proper feeding schedules and diet plans, as different dragon species have varying nutritional needs. In addition to physical care, students explore the emotional aspects of dragon behavior. Dragons can experience fear, anxiety, and even grief, and it is the rider’s responsibility to provide reassurance during stressful times. Students also study the seasonal habits of dragons, such as migration patterns and nesting behaviors, to ensure their dragon remains comfortable throughout the year. A key element of this course is fostering trust and respect—dragons are not just animals to be managed but companions with complex emotional lives. By the end, students will have the knowledge and skills needed to ensure their dragon stays healthy, happy, and ready for any adventure.</p>
